# Model Card: Sentence Complexity Predictor

## Model Details

Name: Sentence Complexity Predictor
Version: 1.0
Date: 2023-07-25
Framework: sklearn, gensim (Word2Vec)
Model Type: Supervised - Regression
Intended Use: Predicting the complexity of English sentences in children's literature.
Factors: Sentence length, Average word length, Word embeddings
Performance Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared

### Training Data

The model was trained on the Brown Corpus, a collection of documents that are broadly representative of English texts, and a new corpus consisting of a collection of children's fairy tales.

### Evaluation Data

The model was evaluated on a separate subset of the training data, which was set aside as a test set during the data splitting process.

### Intended Users

The intended users of the model are educators, researchers, and developers who are interested in assessing the complexity of English text, particularly in the context of children's literature.

### Considerations for Using the Model

The model is designed for use with English text and may not perform well with text in other languages.
The model's performance is dependent on the quality and representativeness of the training data. It is trained on a corpus of children's literature and may not generalize well to other types of text.
The model uses a combination of sentence-level features derived from word embeddings and other sentence characteristics. These features may not capture all aspects of sentence complexity.
